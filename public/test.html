        chapter, we set the scene for what's ahead by introducing fraud
        analytics using descriptive, predictive, and social network techniques.
        We start off by defining and characterizing fraud and discuss different
        types of fraud. Next, fraud detection and prevention is discussed as a
        means to address and limit the amount and overall impact of fraud. Big
        data and analytics provide powerful tools that may improve an
        organization's fraud detection system. We discuss in detail how and why
        these tools complement traditional expert-based fraud-detection
        approaches. Subsequently, the fraud analytics process model is
        introduced, providing a high-level overview of the steps that are
        followed in developing and implementing a data-driven fraud-detection
        system. The chapter concludes by discussing the characteristics and
        skills of a good fraud data scientist, followed by a scientific
        perspective on the topic.

        Since a thorough discussion or investigation requires clear and precise
        definitions of the subject of interest, this first section starts by
        defining fraud and by highlighting a number of essential
        characteristics. Subsequently, an explanatory conceptual model will be
        introduced that provides deeper insight in the underlying drivers of
        fraudsters, the individuals committing fraud. Insight in the field of
        application—or in other words, expert knowledge—is crucial for analytics
        to be successfully applied in any setting, and matters eventually as
        much as technical skill. Expert knowledge or insight in the problem at
        hand helps an analyst in gathering and processing the right information
        in the right manner, and to customize data allowing analytical
        techniques to perform as well as possible in detecting fraud.

        The <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> defines fraud as follows:

        On the one hand, this definition captures the essence of fraud and
        covers the many different forms and types of fraud that will be
        discussed in this book. On the other hand, it does not very precisely
        describe the nature and characteristics of fraud, and as such, does not
        provide much direction for discussing the requirements of a fraud
        detection system. A more useful definition will be provided below.

        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="3" id="Page_3"></span>Fraud is
        definitely not a recent phenomenon unique to modern society, nor is it
        even unique to mankind. Animal species also engage in what could be
        called <i>fraudulent activities</i>, although maybe we should classify
        the behavior as displayed by, for instance, chameleons, stick insects,
        apes, and others rather as <i>manipulative behavior</i> instead of
        fraudulent activities, since <i>wrongful</i> or <i>criminal</i> are
        human categories or concepts that do not straightforwardly apply to
        animals. Indeed, whether activities are <i>wrongful</i> or
        <i>criminal</i> depends on the applicable rules or legislation, which
        defines explicitly and formally these categories that are required in
        order to be able to classify behavior as being fraudulent.

        This definition highlights five characteristics that are associated with
        particular challenges related to developing a fraud-detection system,
        which is the main topic of this book. The first emphasized
        characteristic and associated challenge concerns the fact that fraud is
        <i><b>uncommon</b></i
        >. Independent of the exact setting or application, only a minority of
        the involved population of cases typically concerns fraud, of which
        furthermore only a limited number will be known to concern fraud. This
        makes it difficult to both detect fraud, since the fraudulent cases are
        covered by the nonfraudulent ones, as well as to learn from historical
        cases to build a powerful fraud-detection system since only few examples
        are available.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0011">
        In fact, fraudsters exactly try to blend in and not to behave different
        from others in order not to get noticed and to remain covered by
        nonfraudsters. This effectively makes fraud
        <i><b>imperceptibly concealed</b></i
        >, since fraudsters do succeed in hiding by
        <i><b>well considering</b></i> and planning how to precisely commit
        fraud. Their behavior is definitely not impulsive and unplanned, since
        if it were, detection would be far easier.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0012">
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="4" id="Page_4"></span>They also adapt
        and refine their methods, which they need to do in order to remain
        undetected. Fraud-detection systems improve and learn by example.
        Therefore, the techniques and tricks fraudsters adopt
        <i><b>evolve in time</b></i> along with, or better ahead of
        fraud-detection mechanisms. This cat-and-mouse play between fraudsters
        and fraud fighters may seem to be an endless game, yet there is no
        alternative solution so far. By adopting and developing advanced
        fraud-detection and prevention mechanisms, organizations do manage to
        reduce losses due to fraud because fraudsters, like other criminals,
        tend to look for the easy way and will look for other, easier
        opportunities. Therefore, fighting fraud by building advanced and
        powerful detection systems is definitely not a pointless effort, but
        admittedly, it is very likely an effort without end.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0013">
        Fraud is often as well a <i><b>carefully organized</b></i> crime,
        meaning that fraudsters often do not operate independently, have allies,
        and may induce copycats. Moreover, several fraud types such as money
        laundering and carousel fraud involve complex structures that are set up
        in order to commit fraud in an organized manner. This makes fraud not to
        be an isolated event, and as such in order to detect fraud the context
        (e.g., the social network of fraudsters) should be taken into account.
        Research shows that fraudulent companies indeed are more connected to
        other fraudulent companies than to nonfraudulent companies, as shown in
        a company tax-evasion case study by Van Vlasselaer et al. (2015). Social
        network analytics for fraud detection, as discussed in
        <a
          href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fraud-analytics-using/9781119133124/c05.xhtml"
          >Chapter 5</a
        >, appears to be a powerful tool for unmasking fraud by making clever
        use of contextual information describing the network or environment of
        an entity.

      <p id="c01-para-0014">
        A final element in the description of fraud provided by Van Vlasselaer
        et al. indicates the <i><b>many different types of forms</b></i> in
        which fraud occurs. This both refers to the wide set of techniques and
        approaches used by fraudsters as well as to the many different settings
        in which fraud occurs or economic activities that are susceptible to
        fraud.

                Some common credit card fraud subtypes are counterfeiting credit
                cards (for the definition of counterfeit, see below), using lost
                or stolen cards, or fraudulently acquiring credit through mail
                (definition adopted from
                <a

                  >definitions.uslegal.com</a
                >). Two subtypes can been identified, as described by Bolton and
                Hand (2002): (1) Application fraud, involving individuals
                obtaining new credit cards from issuing companies by using false
                personal information, and then spending as much as possible in a
                short space of time; (2) Behavioral fraud, where details of
                legitimate cards are obtained fraudulently and sales are made on
                a “Cardholder Not Present” basis. This does not necessarily
                require stealing the physical card, only stealing the card
                credentials. Behavioral fraud concerns most of the credit card
                fraud. Also, debit card fraud occurs, although less frequent.
                Credit card fraud is a form of identity theft, as will be
                defined below.

        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="8" id="Page_8"></span>This basic
        conceptual model explains the factors that together cause or explain the
        drivers for an individual to commit <i>occupational</i> fraud, yet
        provides a useful insight in the fraud phenomenon from a broader point
        of view as well. The model has three legs that together institute
        fraudulent behavior:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <i><b>Pressure</b></i> is the first leg and concerns the main
          motivation for committing fraud. An individual will commit fraud
          because a pressure or a problem is experienced of financial, social,
          or any other nature, and it cannot be resolved or relieved in an
          authorized manner.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><b>Opportunity</b></i> is the second leg of the model, and concerns
          the precondition for an individual to be able to commit fraud.
          Fraudulent activities can only be committed when the opportunity
          exists for the individual to resolve or relieve the experienced
          pressure or problem in an unauthorized but concealed or hidden manner.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><b>Rationalization</b></i> is the psychological mechanism that
          explains why fraudsters do not refrain from committing fraud and think
          of their conduct as acceptable.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p id="c01-para-0019">
        An essay by Duffield and Grabosky (2001) further explores the
        motivational basis of fraud from a psychological perspective. It
        concludes that a number of psychological factors may be present in those
        persons who commit fraud, but that these factors are also associated
        with entirely legitimate forms of human endeavor. And so fraudsters
        cannot be distinguished from nonfraudsters purely based on psychological
        characteristics or patterns.

        social phenomenon in the sense that the potential benefits for the
        fraudsters come at the expense of the victims. These victims are
        individuals, enterprises, or the government, and as such society as a
        whole. Some recent numbers give an indication of the estimated
        <i>size</i> and the financial impact of fraud:
      </p>

          The total cost of insurance fraud (non–health insurance) in the United

          Credit card companies “lose approximately seven cents per every

          The average size of the informal economy, as a percent of official GNI

        Even though these numbers are rough estimates rather than exact
        measurements, they are based on evidence and do indicate the importance
        and impact of the phenomenon, and therefore as well the need for
        organizations and governments to actively fight and prevent fraud with
        all means they have at their disposal. As will be further elaborated in
        the final chapter, these numbers also indicate that it is likely
        worthwhile to invest in fraud-detection and fraud-prevention systems,
        since a significant financial return on investment can be made.

        interesting, would lead us too far into the particularities of each of
        these forms of fraud. One may refer to the further reading sections at
        the end of each chapter of this book, providing selected references to
        specialized literature on different forms of fraud. A number of

      <p>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="10" id="Page_10"></span>Two
        components that are essential parts of almost any effective strategy to
        fight fraud concern <i>fraud detection</i> and <i>fraud prevention</i>.
        Fraud detection refers to the ability to recognize or discover
        fraudulent activities, whereas fraud prevention refers to measures that
        can be taken to avoid or reduce fraud. The difference between both is
        clear-cut; the former is an ex post approach whereas the latter an ex
        ante approach. Both tools may and likely should be used in a
        complementary manner to pursue the shared objective,
        <i>fraud reduction</i>.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0024">
        However, as will be discussed in more detail further on, preventive
        actions will change fraud strategies and consequently impact detection
        power. Installing a detection system will cause fraudsters to adapt and
        change their behavior, and so the detection system itself will impair
        eventually its own detection power. So although complementary, fraud
        detection and prevention are not independent and therefore should be
        aligned and considered a whole.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0025">
        The classic approach to fraud detection is an
        <i>expert-based approach,</i> meaning that it builds on the experience,
        intuition, and business or domain knowledge of the fraud analyst. Such
        an expert-based approach typically involves a manual investigation of a
        suspicious case, which may have been signaled, for instance, by a
        customer complaining of being charged for transactions he did not do.
        Such a disputed transaction may indicate a new <i>fraud mechanism</i> to
        have been discovered or developed by fraudsters, and therefore requires
        a detailed investigation for the organization to understand and
        subsequently address the new mechanism.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0026">
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="11" id="Page_11"></span>Comprehension
        of the fraud mechanism or pattern allows extending the fraud detection
        and prevention mechanism that is often implemented as a rule base or
        engine, meaning in the form of a set of If-Then rules, by adding rules
        that describe the newly detected fraud mechanism. These rules, together
        with rules describing previously detected fraud patterns, are applied to
        future <i>cases</i> or transactions and trigger an alert or signal when
        fraud is or may be committed by use of this mechanism. A simple, yet
        possibly very effective, example of a fraud detection rule in an
        insurance claim fraud setting goes as follows:
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0027">IF:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Amount of claim is above threshold OR</li>
        <li>Severe accident, but no police report OR</li>
        <li>Severe injury, but no doctor report OR</li>
        <li>Claimant has multiple versions of the accident OR</li>
        <li>Multiple receipts submitted</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="c01-para-0028">THEN:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flag claim as suspicious AND</li>
        <li>Alert fraud investigation officer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="c01-para-0029">
        Such an expert approach suffers from a number of disadvantages. Rule
        bases or engines are typically expensive to build, since they require
        advanced manual input by the fraud experts, and often turn out to be
        difficult to maintain and manage. Rules have to be kept up to date and
        only or mostly trigger real fraudulent cases, since every signaled case
        requires human follow-up and investigation. Therefore, the main
        challenge concerns keeping the rule base lean and effective—in other
        words, deciding when and which rules to add, remove, update, or merge.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0030">
        It is important to realize that fraudsters can, for instance by trial
        and error, learn the business rules that block or expose them and will
        devise inventive workarounds. Since the rules in the rule-based
        detection system are based on past experience, new emerging fraud
        patterns are not automatically flagged or signaled. Fraud is a dynamic
        phenomenon, as will be discussed below in more detail, and therefore
        needs to be traced continuously. Consequently, a fraud detection and
        prevention system also needs to be continuously monitored, improved, and
        updated to remain effective.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0031">
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="12" id="Page_12"></span>An
        expert-based fraud-detection system relies on human expert input,
        evaluation, and monitoring, and as such involves a great deal of labor
        intense human interventions. An automated approach to build and maintain
        a fraud-detection system, requiring less human involvement, could lead
        to a more efficient and effective system for detecting fraud. The next
        section in this chapter will introduce several alternative approaches to
        expert systems that leverage the massive amounts of data that nowadays
        can be gathered and processed at very low cost, in order to develop,
        monitor, and update a high-performing fraud-detection system in a more
        automated and efficient manner. These alternative approaches still
        require and build on expert knowledge and input, which remains crucial
        in order to build an effective system.

      <h2><a id="c01_level1_4"></a>Big Data for Fraud Detection</h2>
      <p>
        When fraudulent activities have been detected and confirmed to
        effectively concern fraud, two types of measures are typically taken:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <i>Corrective measures,</i> that aim to resolve the fraud and correct
          the wrongful consequences—for instance by means of pursuing
          restitution or compensation for the incurred losses. These corrective
          measures might also include actions to retrospectively detect and
          subsequently address similar fraud cases that made use of the same
          mechanism or loopholes in the fraud detection and prevention system
          the organization has in place.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Preventive measures,</i> which may
          <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="16" id="Page_16"></span>both
          include actions that aim at preventing future fraud by the caught
          fraudster (e.g., by terminating a contractual agreement with a
          customer, as well as actions that aim at preventing fraud of the same
          type by other individuals). When an expert-based approach is adopted,
          an example preventive measure is to extend the rule engine by
          incorporating additional rules that allow detecting and preventing the
          uncovered fraud mechanism to be applied in the future. A fraud case
          must be investigated thoroughly so the underlying mechanism can be
          unraveled, extending the available expert knowledge and allowing it to
          prevent the fraud mechanism to be used again in the future by making
          the organization more robust and less vulnerable to fraud by adjusting
          the detection and prevention system.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p id="c01-para-0046">
        Typically, the sooner corrective measures are taken and therefore the
        sooner fraud is detected, the more effective such measures may be and
        the more losses can be avoided or recompensed. On the other hand, fraud
        becomes easier to detect the more time has passed, for a number of
        particular reasons.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0047">
        When a fraud mechanism or <i>path</i> exists—meaning a loophole in the
        detection and prevention system of an organization—the number of times
        this path will be followed (i.e., the fraud mechanism used) grows in
        time and therefore as well the number of occurrences of this particular
        type of fraud. The more a fraud path is taken the more apparent it
        becomes and typically, in fact statistically, the easier to detect. The
        number of occurrences of a particular type of fraud can be expected to
        grow since many fraudsters appear to be repeat offenders. As the
        expression goes, “<i>Once a thief, always a thief</i>.” Moreover, a
        fraud mechanism may well be discovered by several individuals or the
        knowledge shared between fraudsters. As will be shown in
        <a
          href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fraud-analytics-using/9781119133124/c05.xhtml"
          >Chapter 5</a
        >
        on social network analytics for fraud detection, certainly some types of
        fraud tend to spread virally and display what are called social network
        effects, indicating that fraudsters share their knowledge on how to
        commit fraud. This effect, too, leads to a growing number of occurrences
        and, therefore, a higher risk or chance, depending on one's perspective,
        of detection.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0048">
        Once <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="17" id="Page_17"></span>a case
        of a particular type of fraud has been revealed, this will lead to the
        exposition of similar fraud cases that were committed in the past and
        made use of the same mechanism. Typically, a retrospective screening is
        performed to assess the size or impact of the newly detected type of
        fraud, as well as to resolve (by means of corrective measures, cf.
        supra) as much as possible fraud cases. As such, fraud becomes easier to
        detect the more time has passed, since more similar fraud cases will
        occur in time, increasing the probability that the particular fraud type
        will be uncovered, as well as because fraudsters committing repeated
        fraud will increase their individual risk of being exposed. The
        individual risk will increase the more fraud a fraudster commits for the
        same basic reason: The chances of getting noticed get larger.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0049">
        A final reason why fraud becomes easier to detect the more time has
        passed is because better detection techniques are being developed, are
        getting readily available, and are being implemented and applied by a
        growing amount of organizations. An important driver for improvements
        with respect to detection techniques is
        <i>growing data availability</i>. The informatization and digitalization
        of almost every aspect of society and daily life leads to an abundance
        of available data. This so-called big data can be explored and exploited
        for a range of purposes including fraud detection (Baesens 2014), at a
        very low cost.

      <h2><a id="c01_level1_5"></a>Data-Driven Fraud Detection</h2>
      <p>
        Although classic, expert-based fraud-detection approaches as discussed
        before are still in widespread use and definitely represent a good
        starting point and complementary tool for an organization to develop an
        effective fraud-detection and prevention system, a shift is taking place
        toward data-driven or statistically based fraud-detection methodologies
        for three apparent reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <i>Precision</i>. Statistically based fraud-detection methodologies
          offer an increased detection power compared to classic approaches. By
          processing massive volumes of information, fraud patterns may be
          uncovered that are not sufficiently apparent to the human eye. It is
          important to notice that the improved power of data-driven approaches
          over human processing can be observed in similar applications such as
          credit scoring or customer churn prediction. Most organizations only
          have a limited capacity to have cases checked by an inspector to
          confirm whether or not the case effectively concerns fraud. The goal
          of a fraud-detection system may be to make the most optimal use of the
          limited available inspection capacity, or in other words to maximize
          the fraction of fraudulent cases among the inspected cases (and
          possibly in addition, the detected amount of fraud). A system with
          higher precision, as delivered by data-based methodologies, directly
          translates in a higher fraction of fraudulent inspected cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Operational efficiency</i>.
          <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="18" id="Page_18"></span>In certain
          settings, there is an increasing amount of cases to be analyzed,
          requiring an automated process as offered by data-driven
          fraud-detection methodologies. Moreover, in several applications,
          operational requirements exist, imposing time constraints on the
          processing of a case. For instance, when evaluating a transaction with
          a credit card, an almost immediate decision is required with respect
          to approve or block the transaction because of suspicion of fraud.
          Another example concerns fraud detection for customs in a harbor,
          where a decision has to be made within a confined time window whether
          to let a container pass and be shipped inland, or whether to further
          inspect it, possibly causing delays. Automated data-driven approaches
          offer such functionality and are able to comply with stringent
          operational requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Cost efficiency</i>. As already mentioned in the previous section,
          developing and maintaining an effective and lean expert-based
          fraud-detection system is both challenging and labor intensive. A more
          automated and, as such, more efficient approach to develop and
          maintain a fraud-detection system, as offered by data-driven
          methodologies, is preferred.

          fraud-detection models.

      </ol>
      <p id="c01-para-0051">
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="19" id="Page_19"></span>An additional
        driver for the development of improved fraud-detection technologies
        concerns the growing amount of interest that fraud detection is
        attracting from the general public, the media, governments, and
        enterprises. This increasing awareness and attention for fraud is likely
        due to its large negative social as well as financial impact, and leads
        to growing investments and research into the matter, both from academia,
        industry, and government.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0052">
        Although fraud-detection approaches have gained significant power over
        the past years by adopting potent statistically based methodologies and
        by analyzing massive amounts of data in order to discover fraud patterns
        and mechanisms, still fraud remains hard to detect. It appears the
        Pareto principle holds with respect to the required effort and
        difficulty of detecting fraud: It appears the principle of decreasing
        returns holds with respect to the required effort and so forth. In order
        to explain the <i>hardness</i> and complexity of the problem, it is
        important to acknowledge the fact that fraud is a dynamic phenomenon,
        meaning that its nature changes in time. Not only fraud-detection
        mechanisms evolve, but also fraudsters adapt their approaches and are
        inventive in finding more refined and less apparent ways to commit fraud
        without being exposed. Fraudsters probe fraud-detection and prevention
        systems to understand their functioning and to discover their
        weaknesses, allowing them to adapt their methods and strategies.

      <h2><a id="c01_level1_6"></a>Fraud-Detection Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        Indeed, fraudsters develop advanced strategies to cleverly cover their
        tracks in order to avoid being uncovered. Fraudsters tend to try and
        blend in as much as possible into the surroundings. Such an approach
        reminds of camouflage techniques as used by the military or by animals
        such as chameleons and stick insects. This is clearly no fraud by
        opportunity, but rather, is carefully planned, leading to a need for new
        techniques that are able to detect and address patterns that initially
        seem to comply with normal behavior, but in reality instigate fraudulent
        activities.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0054">
        Detection mechanisms based on unsupervised learning techniques or
        descriptive analytics, as discussed in
        <a
          href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fraud-analytics-using/9781119133124/c03.xhtml"
          >Chapter 3</a
        >, typically aim at finding behavior that <i>deviates</i> from
        <i>normal</i> behavior, or in other words at detecting anomalies. These
        techniques learn from historical observations, and are called
        unsupervised since they do not require these observations to be labeled
        as either a fraudulent or a nonfraudulent example case. An example of
        behavior that does not comply with <i>normal behavior</i> in a
        telecommunications subscription fraud setting is provided by the
        transaction data set with call detail records of a particular subscriber
        shown in
        <a

        >
        (Fawcett and Provost 1997). Remark that the calls found to be fraudulent
        (last column in the table indicating <i>bandit</i>) are not suspicious
        by themselves; however, they are deviating from normal behavior for this
        particular subscriber.

        >Outlier-detection techniques have great value and allow detecting a
        significant fraction of fraudulent cases. In particular, they might
        allow detecting fraud that is different in nature from historical fraud,
        or in other words fraud that makes use of new, unknown mechanisms
        resulting in a <i>novel fraud pattern</i>. These new patterns are not
        discovered by expert systems, and as such descriptive analytics may be a
        first complementary tool to be adopted by an organization in order to
        improve its expert rule–based fraud-detection system.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0058">
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="21" id="Page_21"></span>Descriptive
        techniques however show to be prone to deception, exactly by the
        camouflage-like fraud strategies already discussed. Therefore, the
        detection system can be further improved by complementing it by a tool
        that is able to unmask fraudsters adopting a camouflage-like technique.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0059">
        Therefore, in
        <a
          href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fraud-analytics-using/9781119133124/c04.xhtml"
          >Chapter 4</a
        >, a second type of techniques is introduced. Supervised learning
        techniques or predictive analytics aim to learn from historical
        information or observations in order to retrieve patterns that allow
        differentiating between normal and fraudulent behavior. These techniques
        exactly aim at finding silent alarms, the parts of their tracks that
        fraudsters cannot cover up. Supervised learners can be applied to
        predict or detect fraud as well as to estimate the amount of fraud.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0060">
        Predictive analytics has limitations as well, probably the most
        important one being that they need historical examples to learn from
        (i.e., a labeled data set of historically observed fraud behavior). This
        reduces their detection power with respect to drastically different
        fraud types making use of new mechanisms or methods, and which have not
        been detected thus far and are therefore not included in the historical
        database of fraud cases from which the predictive model was learned. As
        already discussed, descriptive analytics may perform better with respect
        to detecting such new fraud mechanisms, at least if a new fraud
        mechanism leads to detectable deviations from <i>normality</i>. This
        illustrates the complementarity of supervised and unsupervised methods
        and motivates the use of both types of methods as complementary tools in
        developing a powerful fraud-detection and prevention system.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0061">
        A third type of complementary tool concerns social network analysis,
        which further extends the abilities of the fraud-detection system by
        learning and detecting characteristics of fraudulent behavior in a
        network of linked entities. Social network analytics is the newest tool
        in our toolbox to fight fraud, and proofs to be a very powerful means as
        will appear from the discussion and presented case study in
        <a
          href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fraud-analytics-using/9781119133124/c05.xhtml"
          >Chapter 5</a
        >. Social network analytics allows including an extra source of
        information in the analysis, being the relationships between entities,
        and as such may contribute in uncovering particular patterns indicating
        fraud.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0062">
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="22" id="Page_22"></span>It is
        important to stress that these three different types of techniques may
        complement each other since they focus on different aspects of fraud and
        are not to be considered as exclusive alternatives. An effective
        fraud-detection and prevention system will make use of and combine these
        different tools, which have different possibilities and limitations and
        therefore reinforce each other when applied in a combined setup. When
        developing a fraud-detection system, an organization will likely follow
        the order in which the different tools have been introduced; as a first
        step an expert-based rule engine may be developed, which in a second
        step may be complemented by descriptive analytics, and subsequently by
        predictive and social network analytics. Developing a fraud-detection
        system in this order allows the organization to gain expertise and
        insight in a stepwise manner, hereby facilitating each next step.
        However, the exact order of adopting the different techniques may depend
        on the characteristics of the type of fraud an organization is faced
        with.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Fraud detection</b>: Applying detection models on new, unseen
          observations and assigning a fraud risk to every observation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fraud investigation</b>: A human expert is often required to
          investigate suspicious, flagged cases given the involved subtlety and
          complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fraud confirmation</b>: Determining <i>true</i> fraud label,
          possibly involving field research.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fraud prevention</b>: Preventing fraud to be committed in the
          future. This might even result in detecting fraud even before the
          fraudster knows s/he will commit fraud, which is exactly the premise
          of the 1956 science fiction short story <i>Minority Report</i> by
          Philip K. Dick.

        from the fraud confirmation activity toward the fraud-detection
        activity. Newly detected cases should be added (as soon as possible!) to
        the database of historical fraud cases, which is used to learn or induce
        the detection model. The fraud-detection model may not be retrained
        every time a new case is confirmed; however, a regular update of the
        model is recommendable given the dynamic nature of fraud and the
        importance of detecting fraud as soon as possible. The required
        frequency of retraining or updating the detection model depends on
        several factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The volatility of the fraud behavior</li>
        <li>
          The detection power of the current model, which is related to the
          volatility of the fraud behavior
        </li>
        <li>
          The amount of (similar) confirmed cases already available in the
          database
        </li>
        <li>The rate at which new cases are being confirmed</li>
        <li>The required effort to retrain the model</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="c01-para-0065">
        Depending on the emerging need for retraining as determined by these
        factors, as well as possible additional factors, an automated approach
        such as reinforcement learning may be considered which continuously
        updates the detection model by learning from the newest observations.

        high-level overview of the analytics process model (Han and Kamber 2011;
        Hand, Mannila, and Smyth 2001; Tan, Steinbach, and Kumar 2005). As a
        first step, a thorough definition of the business problem is needed to
        be solved with analytics. Next, all source data must be identified that
        could be of potential interest. This is a very important step, as data
        are the key ingredient to any analytical exercise and the selection of
        data will have a deterministic impact on the analytical models that will
        be built in a subsequent step. All data will then be gathered in a
        staging area that could be a data mart or data warehouse. Some basic
        exploratory analysis can be considered here using for instance OLAP
        (online analytical processing, see
        <a
          href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fraud-analytics-using/9781119133124/c03.xhtml"
          >Chapter 3</a
        >) facilities for multidimensional data analysis (e.g., roll-up, drill
        down, slicing and dicing). This will be followed by a data-cleaning step
        to get rid of all inconsistencies, such as missing values and duplicate
        data. Additional transformations may also be considered, such as
        binning, alphanumeric to numeric coding, geographical aggregation, and
        so on. In the analytics step, an analytical model will be estimated on
        the preprocessed and transformed data. In this stage, the actual
        fraud-detection model is built. Finally, once the model has been built,
        it will be interpreted and evaluated by the fraud experts.

        patterns that may be detected by the model, for instance similar to
        expert rules, are interesting as they provide some validation of the
        model. But of course, the key issue is to find the unknown yet
        interesting and actionable patterns (sometimes also referred to as
        knowledge diamonds) that can provide added insight and detection power.
        Once the analytical model has been appropriately validated and approved,
        it can be put into production as an analytics application (e.g.,
        decision support system, scoring engine). Important to consider here is
        how to represent the model output in a user-friendly way, how to
        integrate it with other applications (e.g., detection and prevention
        system, risk engines), and how to make sure the analytical model can be
        appropriately monitored and backtested on an ongoing basis. These

        is iterative in nature in the sense that one may have to go back to
        previous steps during the exercise. For example, during the analytics
        step, the need for additional data may be identified, which may
        necessitate additional cleaning, transformation, and so on. The most
        time-consuming step typically is the data selection and preprocessing
        step, which usually takes around 80 percent of the total efforts needed

                significance, meaning that the patterns that have been found in

                When a deeper understanding of the detected fraud patterns is
                required, for instance to validate the model before it is
                adopted for use, a fraud-detection model may have to be
                interpretable. This aspect involves a certain degree of
                subjectivism, since interpretability may depend on the user's
                knowledge. The interpretability of a model depends on its
                format, which, in turn, is determined by the adopted analytical
                technique. Models that allow the user to understand the
                underlying reasons why the model signals a case to be suspicious
                are called white-box models, whereas complex incomprehensible
                mathematical models are often referred to as black-box models.
                It may well be in a fraud-detection setting that black-box
                models are acceptable, although in most settings some level of
                understanding and in fact validation which is facilitated by
                interpretability is required for the management to have
                confidence and allow the effective operationalization of the
                model.

        A number of particular challenges may present themselves when developing
        and implementing a fraud-detection model, possibly leading to
        difficulties in meeting the objectives as expressed by the
        characteristics discussed in
        <a

          >Table 1.4</a
        >. A first key challenge concerns the dynamic nature of fraud.
        Fraudsters constantly try to beat detection and prevention systems by
        developing new strategies and methods. Therefore, adaptive analytical
        models and detection and prevention systems are required, in order to
        detect and resolve fraud as soon as possible. Detecting fraud as early
        as possible is crucial, as discussed before.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0077">
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="29" id="Page_29"></span>Clearly, it
        is also crucial to detect fraud as accurately as possible, and not to
        miss out on too many fraud cases, especially on fraud cases involving a
        large amount or financial impact. The cost of missing a fraudulent case
        or a fraud mechanism may be significant. Related to having good
        detection power is the requirement of having at the same time a low
        false alarm rate, since we also want to avoid harassing good customers
        and prevent accounts or transactions to be blocked unnecessarily.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0078">
        In developing analytical models with good detection power and low false
        alarm rate, an additional difficulty concerns the skewedness of the
        data, meaning that we typically have plenty of historical examples of
        nonfraudulent cases, but only a limited number of fraudulent cases. For
        instance, in a credit card fraud setting, typically less than 0.5
        percent of transactions are fraudulent. Such a problem is commonly
        referred to as a needle-in-a-haystack problem and might cause an
        analytical technique to experience difficulties in learning an accurate
        model. A number of approaches to address the skewedness of the data will
        be discussed in
        <a
          href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fraud-analytics-using/9781119133124/c04.xhtml"
          >Chapter 4</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p id="c01-para-0079">
        Depending on the exact application, also operational efficiency may be a
        key requirement, meaning that the fraud-detection system might only have
        a limited amount of time available to reach a decision and let a
        transaction pass or not. As an example, in a credit card fraud-detection
        setting the decision time has to be typically less than eight seconds.
        Such a requirement clearly impacts the design of the operational IT
        systems, but also the design of the analytical model. The analytical
        model should not take too long to be evaluated, and the information or
        the variables that are used by the model should not take too long to be
        gathered or calculated. Calculating trend variables in real time, for
        instance, may not be feasible from an operational perspective, since
        this is taking too much valuable time. This also relates to the final
        challenge of dealing with the massive volumes of data that are available
        and need to be processed.

          <a id="c01_level2_1"></a>A Fraud Data Scientist Should Have Solid
          Quantitative Skills
        </h3>
        <p>
          Obviously, a fraud data scientist should have a thorough background in
          statistics, machine learning and/or data mining. The distinction
          between these various disciplines is getting more and more blurred and
          is actually not that relevant. They all provide a set of quantitative
          techniques to analyze data and find business relevant patterns within
          a particular context such as fraud detection. A data scientist should
          be aware of which technique can be applied when and how. He/she should
          not focus too much on the underlying mathematical (e.g., optimization)
          details but, rather, have a good understanding of what analytical
          problem a technique solves, and how its results should be interpreted.
          In this context, the education of engineers in computer science and/or
          business/industrial engineering should aim at an integrated,
          multidisciplinary view, with graduates formed in both the use of the
          techniques, and with the business acumen necessary to bring new
          endeavors to fruition. Also important is to spend enough time
          validating the analytical results obtained so as to avoid situations
          often referred to as data massage and/or data torture whereby data is
          (intentionally) misrepresented and/or too much focus is spent
          discussing spurious correlations. When selecting the optimal
          quantitative technique, the fraud data scientist should take into
          account the specificities of the context and the problem or
          fraud-detection application at hand. Typical requirements for
          fraud-detection models have been discussed in the previous section and
          the fraud data scientist should have a basic understanding and feeling
          for all of those. Based on a combination of these requirements, the
          data scientist should be capable of selecting the best analytical
          technique to solve the particular business problem.

          <a id="c01_level2_2"></a>A Fraud Data Scientist Should Be a Good
          Programmer
        </h3>
        <p>
          <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="31" id="Page_31"></span>As per
          definition, data scientists work with data. This involves plenty of
          activities such as sampling and preprocessing of data, model
          estimation and post-processing (e.g., sensitivity analysis, model
          deployment, backtesting, model validation). Although many
          user-friendly software tools are on the market nowadays to automate
          and support these tasks, every analytical exercise requires tailored
          steps to tackle the specificities of a particular business problem and
          setting. In order to successfully perform these steps, programming
          needs to be done. Hence, a good data scientist should possess sound
          programming skills (e.g., SAS, R, Python, etc.). The programming
          language itself is not that important as such, as long as he/she is
          familiar with the basic concepts of programming and knows how to use
          these to automate repetitive tasks or perform specific routines.

        <h3>
          <a id="c01_level2_3"></a>A Fraud Data Scientist Should Excel in
          Communication and Visualization Skills
        </h3>
        <p>
          Like it or not, analytics is a technical exercise. At this moment,
          there is a huge gap between the analytical models and the business
          users. To bridge this gap, communication and visualization facilities
          are key. Hence, data scientists should know how to represent
          analytical models and their accompanying statistics and reports in
          user-friendly ways using traffic-light approaches, OLAP (online
          analytical processing) facilities, If-then business rules, and so on.
          They should be capable of communicating the right amount of
          information without getting lost into complex (e.g., statistical)
          details, which will inhibit a model's successful deployment. By doing
          so, business users will better understand the characteristics and
          behavior in their (big) data which will improve their attitude toward
          and acceptance of the resulting analytical models. Educational
          institutions must learn to balance, since many academic degrees form
          students who are skewed to either too much analytical or too much
          practical knowledge.

          <a id="c01_level2_4"></a>A Fraud Data Scientist Should Have a Solid
          Business Understanding
        </h3>
        <p>
          <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="32" id="Page_32"></span>While this
          might be obvious, we have witnessed (too) many data science projects
          that failed because the respective analyst did not understand the
          business problem at hand. By “business” we refer to the respective
          application area. Several examples of such application areas of
          fraud-detection techniques were summarized in
          <a
            href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fraud-analytics-using/9781119133124/c01.xhtml#c01-tbl-0001"
            >Table 1.1</a
          >. Each of those fields has its own particularities that are important
          for a fraud data scientist to know and understand in order to be able
          to design and implement a customized fraud-detection system. The more
          aligned the detection system with the environment, the better its
          performance will be, as evaluated on each of the dimensions already
          discussed.

        <h3>
          <a id="c01_level2_5"></a>A Fraud Data Scientist Should Be Creative
        </h3>
        <p>
          A data scientist needs creativity on at least two levels. First, on a
          technical level, it is important to be creative with regard to feature
          selection, data transformation, and cleaning. These steps of the
          standard analytics process have to be adapted to each particular
          application, and often the “right guess” could make a big difference.
          Second, big data and analytics is a fast-evolving field. New problems,
          technologies, and corresponding challenges pop up on an ongoing basis.
          Moreover, also fraudsters are very creative and adapt their tactics
          and methods on an ongoing basis. Therefore, it is crucial that a fraud
          data scientist keeps up with these new evolutions and technologies and
          has enough creativity to see how they can create new opportunities.

      <p id="c01-para-0088">A couple of conclusions can be drawn as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          6,174 scientific papers have been published on the topic of fraud
          during the period reported.
        </li>
        <li>
          The h-index is 44, implying that there are at least 44 papers with 44
          citations on the topic of fraud.
        </li>
        <li>
          The number of publications is steadily increasing, which shows a
          growing interest from the academic community and research on the
          topic.
        </li>
        <li>
          The citations are exponentially growing, which is associated with the
          increasing number of publications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Two of the five papers mentioned study the use of analytics for fraud
          detection, clearly illustrating the growing attention in the field for
          data-driven approaches.
